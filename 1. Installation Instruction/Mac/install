Here's a tailored guide for setting up Aiken-lang on macOS:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Rust**: Use `rustup`, the recommended installer for Rust:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
   Follow the on-screen instructions, and make sure to add Rust to your PATH as prompted.

2. **Install Node.js** (if needed): If Aiken-lang has JavaScript dependencies, install Node.js via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

3. **Install Git**: This is necessary to clone the Aiken-lang repository.
   ```bash
   brew install git
   ```

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Aiken-lang Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd aiken
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   If Aiken-lang uses Cargo, the Rust package manager, build it with:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Install Aiken-lang Globally**:
   If Aiken-lang provides a CLI binary, install it:
   ```bash
   cargo install aiken
   ```

5. **Verify the Installation**:
   Confirm that Aiken-lang is installed correctly by checking its version:
   ```bash
   aiken --version
   ```

### Development Environment

To streamline development, consider using **Visual Studio Code** with the **Rust** and **Aiken-lang** syntax extensions. This provides syntax highlighting, linting, and code completion.
