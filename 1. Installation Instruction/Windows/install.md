Here's a guide to install Aiken-lang on Windows, covering Rust, Git, and Node.js setup, along with solutions for common issues you might face on this platform.

---

### 1. **Prerequisites**

1. **Install Rust**:
   - Rust can be installed on Windows using the `rustup` installer, which also includes `cargo`, the Rust package manager.
   - Run this command in PowerShell or Command Prompt:
     ```powershell
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```
   - After installation, make sure Rust’s `cargo` bin directory (`%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`) is added to your PATH automatically. If not, add it manually:
     - Go to **Settings > System > About > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables**.
     - Under **System Variables**, select **Path** > **Edit**, and add:
       ```
       %USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin
       ```
   - **Verify Rust** by running:
     ```powershell
     rustc --version
     cargo --version
     ```

2. **Install Git**:
   - Download Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer.
   - During installation, select **Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software** option to add Git to your PATH.
   - Verify Git installation:
     ```powershell
     git --version
     ```

3. **Install Node.js** (if needed):
   - Download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and run the installer.
   - Confirm Node.js and npm are installed correctly:
     ```powershell
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

### 2. **Cloning the Aiken-lang Repository**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
     ```powershell
     git clone https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken.git
     ```
   - Change directory to the cloned repo:
     ```powershell
     cd aiken
     ```

2. **Building the Project with Cargo**:
   - Build the project using Cargo, the Rust package manager:
     ```powershell
     cargo build --release
     ```

3. **Installing Aiken-lang**:
   - If Aiken-lang has a CLI that you can install globally, run:
     ```powershell
     cargo install --path .
     ```

4. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Check if Aiken-lang is installed by running:
     ```powershell
     aiken --version
     ```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Rust/Cargo PATH Issues**:
   - If the `rustc` or `cargo` commands aren’t recognized, ensure `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` is added to your PATH as described above. Restart your terminal after modifying PATH.

2. **Git Not Recognized**:
   - If `git` is not recognized, confirm Git’s PATH entry was added correctly during installation. You can add it manually if needed:
     ```plaintext
     C:\Program Files\Git\bin
     ```
   
3. **Permission Errors**:
   - For permission issues, especially on Windows 10/11, you may need to run your terminal as Administrator:
     - Right-click **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**, and select **Run as administrator**.

4. **Cargo Build Errors**:
   - If there are build errors, try updating Rust and Cargo:
     ```powershell
     rustup update
     ```
   - If issues persist, clean the build cache:
     ```powershell
     cargo clean
     ```

5. **Running Scripts with Windows Defender**:
   - Windows Defender or other antivirus software may block script execution. If this happens, temporarily disable it or create an exception for the Rust toolchain and Aiken files.
